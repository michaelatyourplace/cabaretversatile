                    Burlesque is a theatrical art form that combines comedy, satire, and striptease. It's often misunderstood as simply stripping, but at its heart, it's about the <strong>"art of the tease"</strong>—a playful, glamorous, and often humorous performance that celebrates self-confidence and body positivity.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5 mb-5">
                    A burlesque performance can be anything from a classic feather fan dance to a high-energy routine set to a pop song. Performers use costumes, props, and facial expressions to tell a story and engage with the audience, making the removal of clothing a theatrical climax rather than the main event.

                <h2 class="text-center">A Brief History</h2>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    The term "burlesque" originated in 19th-century Europe, referring to a literary or dramatic work that makes fun of serious subjects. Over time, it evolved into a popular form of variety entertainment in America, where female performers would use comedy and song to poke fun at the societal norms of the time.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Its golden age was in the early 20th century, but it declined in popularity in the mid-1900s. A modern <strong>neo-burlesque revival</strong> began in the 1990s, led by performers like Dita Von Teese, which brought the art form back to the mainstream and expanded its reach to a diverse new audience.
